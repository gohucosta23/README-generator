# README Generator
<br>

## Description
<br>
<p>  In this project the user can easily create a README.md file for their project right from the command line. The README generator was created using the superpowers of Javascript combined with Node.js. Below you will find instructions and photos that will guide you through the process of installing and running the program. Fun fact... this README was created using the generator.</p>

## Installation
<br>
<p>In order for you to install the program, you (the user), can simply fork this repo or do a git clone. From there, once you are inside index.js you can right click on the file and click on "Open in Terminal". Once the command line window opens you can simply type "node index.js". From there you will be prompted with a question for your github username, which will make a call to the Github url to retrieve your profile image which will be populated on your README for contact purposes. Then, you will be prompted with questions about what will be populated in your README. Once you complete all the questions, you will have a new README file...</p>
